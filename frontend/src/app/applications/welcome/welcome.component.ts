            My love for computer programming started at <b>10</b> with my first personal PC.
            <br><br>
            I've started with some classic Games like <b>Microsoft pinball</b>, and then moved to <b>Age of Empires</b>.
            <br><br>
            The love for video games made me discover the world of <b>programming.</b>
            <br><br>
            <app-link [link]="'https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker'">Game Maker Studio</app-link> was the firts tool I've used for game programming.<br>
            <br>
            After some years of experiments, I've decided to study <b>computer science</b> at secondary school, learning
            <b>Visual Basic</b> and <b>Pascal</b>, and creating my first programs
            <br><br>
            The school itself gives me a lot of fun and experience with programming, but I've decided to study more at the
            <app-link [link]="'https://www.univr.it/it/'">University of Verona</app-link>.
            <br><br>
            After the University, I've started working as <b>Web Fullstack Developer</b>, using <b>PHP, Zend, Javascript and SASS.</b>
            <br><br>
            Here I've decided to focus on creativity, and I've started to specialize as <b>Frontend Developer</b>, learning new things about
            <b>Design and Usability.</b>
            <br><br>
            I've worked with <b>Web and Mobile applications</b>, using custom and generic frameworks, like <b>Angular and React</b>, expecially to
            develop a more <i>accessible, beautiful and performant</i> apps.
            <br><br>
            After 3 years, I've decided to change my career and start to work as <b>self-employed</b>, boosting my skills as frontend developer, and working
            with a lot of new realities.
            <br><br>
            But, why I started my story with my first <i>games and my passion for game development</i> ?<br><br>
            Aside from my main job, my hobby is game development, and this involves also <b>design, music production, and other skills rather than programming.</b>
            I'm using <app-link [link]="'https://unity.com/'">Unity</app-link> since <b>10 years</b> now.<br><br>
            In my free time I love to prototype games and 3D content for web apps, and in 2020 I've decided to make my hobby a <b>full-time job</b>.<br><br>
            So I decided to partecipate at the University of Verona
            <app-link [link]="'https://www.mastergamedev.it/'">Master Game Dev</app-link> course.
            <br><br>
            Here I've learned new languages and tools, like <b>C++, Unreal, FMOD, etc..</b>, and I've decided to specialize as <b>UI Developer</b>
            in the game industry.
